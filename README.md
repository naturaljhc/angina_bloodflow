## Background
### Normal Artery
Healthy Arteries with no obstruction. Blood flows smoothly and the velocity profile is generally parabolic in laminar flow.
### Stable Angina (Atherosclerosis)
Plaque buildup narros the artery, leading to increased resistance and altered flow patterns (constriction or irregularity in the artery)
### Unstable Angina (Atherosclerosis with Blood Clot)
Blood clot further narrows or obstructs the artery, resulting in moree sever flow restrictions and possible turbulence
### Variant Angina (Coronary Spasm)
Temporary constriction of the artery due to muscle contraction. Transient narrowing modeled as a variable or oscillatory constriction
